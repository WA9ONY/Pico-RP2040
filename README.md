# Raspberry Pi Pico & RP2040 Microcontroller Projects

## RP2040 Microcontroller

Rasperry Pi Pico boards area  new popular low cost, powerful microcontroller that was created for education, makers, hobbyiest, etc. in January 2021. In less than two years over 2 million have been sold.  The RP2040 is the microcontroller ASIC used in the Pico boards.  The RP2040 is sold for $1 and is used by many other companies to create boards that include the RP2040.

The RP2040 is a dual core, 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ processor that has very low power requirements. Therefore, it is a good choice for battery operation.

The Raspberry Pi SBC, single board computers, are the third most popular personal computer behind Apple Mac OS, and Window PCs.  A SBC runs a operation system to interface to the user and runs various programs.  In contrast the RP2040 is a microcontroller design to interface to hardware to do a signal task. 

To use a microcontroller it is connected to additional electrical hardware using digital I/O, analog I/O, buses (I2C, SPY, UART, etc.).
