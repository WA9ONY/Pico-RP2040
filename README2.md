## Introduction  
  
This repo focuses on microcontroller-based projects. It documents WA9ONY microcontroller learning experinces, resources used and projects.  This includes the new (2021) RP2040 microcontroller ecosystem that has shook the microcontroller industry with it's high performace, low cost ($1), small size (0.267 square inches) and availablity to other companies so that they can products that include the RP2040 products (Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect).  Microcontrollers would not be complete without understanding how to use the defacto microcontroller standard since 2005, the Arduino microcontroller ecosystem.

The ham radio projects range from a microcontroller board showing its temperature by using its on board LED to indicate the board's temperature in Morse code to a transceivers built with a microcontroller with other hardware.  In the below project 1: ham radio microcontroller books browse through the book contente in the table to see the various ham radio microcontroller projects (&gt;150) that have been written about.  Also, YouTube and the Internet is filled with ham radio microcontroller projects.
  
Microcontroller projects range from using only the microcontroller developement board to attaching various components and various subsystem boards with  standardized serial interfaces (SPI, I2C, STEMMA QT, etc.).
  
Software is needed to program the microcontroller.  The long time defacto standard is Arduino IDE (since 2005) which is based on C++. Also, MicroPython and CircuitPython have large strong microcontroller ecosystems.  This results in different ways to program the microcontroller.
